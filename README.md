Code and exercises from C++ Primer 5th edition

This is my trial at learning C++ by Reading C++ Primer 5th edition. 
The repository contains solved problems and exercisees from the book.
I have tried to stay within the scope of topics that have been taught
till now. There might be more apt way to approch those problems, but
I am sticking to what I now from I learned till now. This may change as I 
revisit the topic on the consecutive readings after I finish the first pass.

I have left out some fairly easy exercises at the beginning.
This is the first pass. A language like C++ cannot be grasped in one go,
so I will be giving the book many more passes and sometimes I may add new 
code as I find them.

Also sometimes I will be adding auxillary exercises which I find over the net
for the corresponsing topic. This is me trying to understand the topic more.
Those exercises will be in a separate folder.
